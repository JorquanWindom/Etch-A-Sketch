# Etch-A-Sketch
This project uses Html CSS and Javascript. The purpose of this project was to test my knowledge of manipulating the DOM using Javascript.
The project prompts the user to specify the grid size. The user is then able to draw on the page by mousing over the cells in the etch a sketch. It also includes buttons that allows the user to reset the grid, draw, and erase.
